# firstaidapp
This app would offer you help to assist on giving first aid should you come across the need to use it. For example, lets say you were the only person on the scene in a situation when someone was injured, the app would assist you in treating the personâ€™s injuries until professional help is available. This app would offer all the information needed to provide assistance and care for the person you are attending to. My partner, Dominique and I think this could be effective because this way you could be of help when/if the time comes and you wouldn't feel useless. You can learn how to handle common first aid emergencies and make someone feel better till professional help arrives. Instead of having to search Google for how to help someone who is "....." this app would have certain topics. This way you are always prepared to be a hero!
